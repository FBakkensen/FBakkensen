## Welcome!

This is my very first post on my new GitHub Pages blog.

### Writing Code Snippets

Since this is a programming blog, showing code is important! Jekyll (with Kramdown/Rouge) supports syntax highlighting using triple backticks and specifying the language:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

```python
def greet(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Developer")
```
